A plugin that allows collecting test data for use on Test Tracer. It is designed to be used with 
the `Pytest BDD`_ tool


Requirements
------------

* `Pytest BDD`_
* A free `Test Tracer`_ account
* An API token that allows uploading the test result



Installation
------------

You can install "pytest-test-tracer-for-pytest" via `pip`_ from `PyPI`_::

    $ pip install pytest-test-tracer-for-pytest-bdd

     - No
     - By default, Test Tracer Runs are grouped one per Pytest run. If you want multiple Pytest runs to be visible in the same Test Tracer Run, you can specify your own unique run reference. Useful if you split up your test runs into several parallel runs
     - A GUID
   * - use-test-tracer
     - No
     - Provide this argument to enable the Test Tracer plugin
     - False
   * - build-version

     - None
   * - test-tracer-project-name
     - Yes
     - The name of the Project that this test is for. You can give it the name of your application, a single microservice, or any other way that you choose to describe the thing being tested.
     - None
   * - branch-name
     - Yes
     - The name of the branch that is being tested
     - None
   * - test-tracer-no-upload
     - No
     - If you provide this argument, Test Tracer will still generate test result data, but it won't attempt to upload it to Test Tracer
     - False
   * - test-tracer-upload-token
     - No
     - If you want to upload results to Test Tracer, you need to specify the API token used to secure the upload
     - None

     - None

Here is an example of using the Test Tracer for Pytest plugin with Git as the source control::

$ pytest --branch-name=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) --build-revision=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) --test-tracer-project-name="Your Project Name" --test-tracer-upload-token="Your Test Tracer Upload Token"
